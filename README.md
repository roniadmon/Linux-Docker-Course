## Operting Systems Exercise

This repository should provide you with hands-on experience on the following topics;
1. processes, threads and the scheduler
1. memory management and virtual memroy
1. kernel space, user space and system calls
1. namespaces
1. networking

While the theory behind these matters is almost universal, we'll focus on Linux, because it's the only operating system that counts.

## Prerequisite 

VM running Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
